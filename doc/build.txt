1. Building prerequisites.

To build plugin you will need 7-zip sources placed alonside plugin folder.
The folder structure should be the following:

- 7z465_src (7-zip sources version 4.65)

    |
     -src

Copy all files from Oberver\patches folder to 7-zip sources
(find files by name in source tree and replace them).

It should build with other MSVC versions,
but project convertion will be required.
